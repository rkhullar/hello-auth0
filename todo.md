## ideas
- [ ] add endpoints to demonstrate permissions
  - [ ] `POST /message`, `GET /message`, `GET /message/{id}`, `PUT /message/{id}`
  - [ ] use MongoDB Atlas for data storage?
- [ ] test auth0 linking to social login
  - if a user has already logged in via Google, can they also log in with credentials or another provider like GitHub or Okta
  - will their Auth0 user id be different based on how they log in?
- [ ] test user registration for an application
  - how to automatically assign roles to users?
- [ ] review permission naming; looks strange in auth0 login widget
- [ ] deploy the api in AWS
- [ ] try out frontend or mobile integrations
  - would need to either reorg codebase or create/reuse another repo for the frontend / mobile app
